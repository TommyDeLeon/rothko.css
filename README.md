# 🎨 Project Documentation: Crafting a Rothko Painting with CSS 🖌️

Welcome to Part 6 of our journey! This is where freeCodeCamp guided us to explore the vibrant world of CSS. Let's dive into the creation of this digital Rothko painting! 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a beautiful blend of **HTML** and **CSS**. HTML is our canvas, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our palette, styling the webpage to perfection.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of CSS styling. We learned how to:
- Create a digital representation of a Rothko painting using HTML and CSS 🎨
- Use divs to create different sections of the painting and CSS properties such as width, height, background-color, margin, box-shadow, border-radius, transform, and filter to style these sections 🖌️

## 🎨 What Was Created
We crafted a digital representation of a Rothko painting. The painting consists of three colored rectangles on a dark background, each with a different size, color, and rotation. The rectangles are blurred to give the painting a soft, glowing effect, reminiscent of Rothko's signature style.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Interactivity:
Our painting is currently static. Adding some interactivity with JavaScript could make it come alive. Imagine being able to change the colors or the blur effect when the user clicks or hovers over a rectangle! 🖱️
### Responsiveness:
Let's make our painting adaptable to different screen sizes. Currently, it has a fixed size, which may not look good on all screens. Let's make art accessible to everyone, regardless of their device! 📱
### Animation:
Let's add some animation to the painting, such as a subtle pulsing effect, to make it more dynamic and interesting. After all, art is all about evoking emotion and capturing attention! 🌟
